This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.3.

## Development server: client (frontend)

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Development server: Server (backend)

Run `npm run start:server` for a backend server in a separate command.

## Database configuration

Create a database here https://cloud.mongodb.com/

Replace the password in nodemon.json and mongoose path in backend/app.js at line number 11. Also make sure, you configure the IP Address, sometimes IP address varries so edit and refresh is in above path. I will show 'active' status means it is active for use.
